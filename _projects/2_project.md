We designed a robotics cane system that leverages computer vision, and insights from psychology and
haptics literature to enable users to navigate to socially preferred empty chairs. Our social-norm aware
chair selection algorithm optimizes for users privacy, convenience and intimacy creating a potential for
blind people to exercise the nuances of seat choices.


Here is the poster presenting the work:
