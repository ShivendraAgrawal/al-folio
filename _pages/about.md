I am a third year Ph.D. student at CU Boulder. I am broadly interested in Human Robotics Interaction (HRI), Computer Vision (CV), 3D Scene Understanding, and Explainable AI. I am particularly interested in the application of these in Assistive Robotics. I am currently developing a smart cane that uses insights from psychology, CV, NLP, haptics, robotics and HRI to assist people with visual impairments perform day-to-day more independently.

Earlier, I developed a smart cane that can [find socially preferred seats and help the user navigate to those](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VP3k-SudX21NZ_HvtA49C2bNZuhjbgAo/view?usp=sharing). Going forward, I am working towards making an end-to-end solution to help people with visual impairment with independent shopping in a grocery store. My current work tries to solve the manipulation guidance problem to help people retrieve the desired item from an aisle. 

When not working, you can find me playing tennis or [biking](https://www.strava.com/athletes/31779193) in the lovely city of Boulder. I also enjoy cooking in my free time and exploring local food and beverages.
Minor-flex - I have more than 20 millions views on my Google Map [contributions](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118433183916755884441/photos/) and have received a rather vibrant blue pair of socks from Google for my service.
