## Instructor
I taught the undergraduate **Algorithms CSCI 3104** class in Fall 2019 with **109** students in my section. I co-created the material with [Dr. Rhonda Hoenigman](https://experts.colorado.edu/display/fisid_152997) and together we taught more than 250 students.

<!-- I received the highest [FCQ](https://www.colorado.edu/fcq/boulder-fcq-results) as an instructor for that class in recent times.  -->
I was also awarded the `Best Part Time Gradute Instructor 2019-2020`.
