## Instructor Algorithms
I taught the undergraduate Algorithms class in Fall 2019 with 109 students in my section. I co-created the material with [Dr. Rhona Hoenigman](https://experts.colorado.edu/display/fisid_152997) and together we taught more than 250 students.
I received the highest [FCQ](https://www.colorado.edu/fcq/boulder-fcq-results) as an instructor for that class in recent times. 
I was also awarded the `Best Part Time Gradute Instructor 2019-2020`.
You can find my live handwritten lecture notes [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vRfMC7lCrVAZzo3dz8qBtgsNyankIEty?usp=sharing).

## YouTube 
My tutorial on 3-CNF SAT to Subset Sum reduction is the most watched and most liked video on the topic.
